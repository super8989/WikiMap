Wiki Map
=========

### Version 1.0.0

Welcome to Wiki Map, an application where you may create customized maps with waypoints (also called pins) based on your personal interests or tastes. Anyone may explore Wiki Map's collection, and you may register to create your own maps, share your contributions into other maps, and create a list of favourite maps, so you may visit and explore them quickly.

# Final Product

Wiki Map is designed to perform in mobile devices, tablets and desktops. Its layout can adapt responsively depending on the device you may be using.

You may navigate any map or visit user profiles as a visitor, but you must be a registered user with a valid User to be able to create maps, contribute, and bookmark (favourite) any maps that feel special to you.
